# AI_ML

I’ve been working on a Jupyter Notebook that covers key aspects of data analysis and machine learning with Python. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the steps included in the notebook:

1. Importing Libraries

Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.

Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing data trends and insights.

Scikit-learn for implementing machine learning models, preprocessing data, and evaluating performance.

Joblib for saving and loading machine learning models efficiently.

2. Data Preprocessing

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features with OneHotEncoder.

Feature Scaling: Using StandardScaler to standardize numerical features.

Train-Test Split: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

3. Building Machine Learning Models

Logistic Regression: Implemented for classification tasks.

Decision Trees: Used as an alternative model to assess performance.

Pipeline: Combined preprocessing steps with model training for seamless workflow management.

4. Model Evaluation

Evaluated the performance of the models using:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report (precision, recall, f1-score)

5. Saving the Model

Joblib is used to save the trained machine learning models for future use and deployment.

6. Visualizations

Used Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating visualizations to better understand the data and model performance.

This notebook provides a practical guide to implementing machine learning algorithms, preprocessing data, and evaluating model performance effectively. It's an exciting project that helped me solidify my understanding of machine learning and Python!

Feel free to check it out and let me know your thoughts. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
